      <p>
        Android application written in Java.This phone application lets users
        make list of expenses to keep track of their money. They can enter an amount
        and specify whether it is income or expense. They can also place that entry
        into a category to help track what they spend their money on. The catergories
        are also graphed in a pie chart too view statistics about their expenses.  <br/></p>

      <p>
        The application uses bottom tabs to navigate between activities. It also
        uses third party library's like Glide and EazeGraph. Glide loads images
        from a URL into an image view. EazeGraph displays a pie chart with
        user information about their expense. It also use SQLite for its database.
        This stores entries in the phone its instead of depending on a external
        database.
