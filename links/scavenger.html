  		<p>About the application</p>

      <p>
        Android application written in Java. Social Media app where users can
        share pictures. The user is prompted with daily challenge where they
        are encourage to go outside and capture a picture of that object in the
        prompt. There is also a profile page where they can view their post and
        and edit their profile</p>

      <p>
        The app is built with Firebase for user authentication and fireStore
        serves as its database to store images and other information that goes
        along with each post. Uses Glide library to load images from a URL into the
        recycler view. Other third party library's used are circleImageView for
        custom circular images and Android-Image-Cropper that lets user retrieve
        and crop images from their gallery.App retrieves date from phone and displays
        on the home page. When clicked on the date a snackbar pops up showing prompt
        but this feature is not currently enabled since the database for prompts
        is not integradeted yet. It uses viewpager with fragments for
        seemless swiping between tabs.
